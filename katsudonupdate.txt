hi. katsudon is down for the time being. i love the fediverse, i love the people in it, i love running a server, however moderation's been too stressful for me to handle. 
i know it sounds stupid, but i'm most concerned about accidentally seeing something that scars me because, y'know, i'm the only one moderating around here.
(in all seriousness though, it's severely trigged my anxiety and it's lifted something off my shoulders temporarily closing the site.)
i figure it's best i shut down the server for now and think about what i want to do, since this has caused me extreme stress.
i've been thinking about the best way to go around this (and have considered making a public instance and hiring/having volunteer mods)
but for now, i'm off the fediverse for the time being.
please feel free to get in touch via discord or my email (contact@(this domain you're on right now))
i'm still on tumblr (http://tumblr.squabbled.net)
and i have a discord server that you should probably join (http://discord.gg/SWCKgzZg9a)
apologies for the sudden drop off on the server and the just .txt file here, i just don't want to leave any hanging and at least give somewhat of an update.
cya around the interwebs,
bit :3

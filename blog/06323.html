  <h1>where i've been</h1>
  <p>been a while since i've updated the site, uploaded to youtube, or really did anything meaningful with the server, huh?</p>
  <p>unfortunately, i've hit a point where i don't really know what to do or how to do anything i want to do.</p>
  <p>the server's been kinda dry lately as i've moved onto other games and don't really have anyone playing, nor do i know how to market/advertise anything</p>
  <p>in addition, i have a crap ton of projects i want to work on outside of this site and everything.</p>
  <h2>going forward</h2>
  <p>going forward, i'm gonna have to stick to one thing. will i do it? probably not.</p>
  <p>my main goals are learning a little more web design and redesigning my website, as well as learning a little more marketing skills for better advertising.</p>
  <p>as of now: i'm gonna be creating new branding and assets like banners, redesigning my websites, and cleaning up the mess around here.</p>
  <p>i also have the problem of my site building skills being straight out of the 90s, as i write this in an html file on notepad.</p>
  <p>anyways, summer's coming up, so hopefully i'll be able to figure things out during that time.</p>
  <p>in the mean time, please bear with this site for a while. some people love it, some hate it. i'm kind of tired of it, so i'm hoping i can update it soon.</p>

<h1>Domain troubles and blogs</h1>
<p>After about half a day, the site is finally back up. I wanted to transfer my domain between Ionos accounts (my domain provider).</p>
<p>I expected everything to go smoothly, and for the most part, it did. I had to fiddle around with some stuff to get it to work *cough cough* cloudflare *cough*</p>
<p>But, in the end, it all seemed to have worked fine. I won't get into why I changed accounts, but it was sort of painful to get working again.</p>
<p>At first, the site seemed fine. Then, it came up with a cloudflare error and after trying to fix that, I messed it up even more, giving me the dreaded "default page" of doom.</p>
<p>After a LOT of trial and error (and eventually giving up and deleting everything to try and start again), here we are.</p>
<p>The site is now ONLY on www.squabbled.net and not at any other address like before.</p>
<p>As for the blog, I'm literally writing this in basic HTML. I recently overhauled the site to be somewhat less of a mess but still keep that simplistic geocities-ish style.</p>
<p>I've wanted to make a blog for a while now, and after some debating just was like, ehh, make it in basic HTML. What could go wrong?</p>
<p>Anyways, enjoy or something.</p>

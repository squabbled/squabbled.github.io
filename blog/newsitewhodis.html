<h1>new site who dis.</h1>
<p>completely taking back most of what i said in the last post, the site's been redesigned.</p>
<p>i'm really proud of it, it's still made with HTML but CSS has been updated heavily, and things are more consistant and has a proper theme.<p>
<p>the site's also been rebranded to bit's bytes, since it fits better than just "squabbledmc" (although it is still used in the branding and on my youtube</p>
<p>i've had a hyperfixation on frutiger aero and while this site isn't exactly 100% frutiger aero, i like it a lot now.<p>
<p>for context: the current design was essentially rushed after the old site was lost and moved over to github pages.</p>
<p>i've been meaning to do a redesign, but never had the energy so after forcing myself to do so, here we are with this new site!</p>
<p>it's not 100% finished, there's still quite a bit i'm in the process of adding, however, i wanted this site to be the public one because it's just so much better.</p>
<p>i hope you enjoy it! i worked really hard on it and i love it, so i hope you all love it too.</p>

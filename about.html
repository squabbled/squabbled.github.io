<h1><img class="icon" src="https://u.cubeupload.com/squabbled/64bemojified.png"> about me :D</h1>
<p>hi, i'm bit! i'm most commonly known as squabbled online, but either works.</p>
<p>i hang around the interwebs lookin for cool stuff to do and make, this site being a prime example of that.</p>
<p>this page is just sort of dedicated to talking about me, my interests, and other cool stuff i've done.</p>
<h2>cool stuff i've done</h2>
<p>the thing i'm most proud of is <a href="https://www.tempuracraft.com>TempuraCraft</a>, my response to pay to win Minecraft servers without a real friendly community, and just survival how the game was intended to play.</p>
<p>another cool thing was katsudon, a mastodon server that was shut down for my mental health's sake. i loved interacting with the fediverse and learning about how the whole thing worked by straight up running a server off a raspi!</p>
<h2>my interests</h2>
<p>1. computers, technology, and anything of that sort.</p>
<p>ever since i was a kid, i've always been really curious as to how things work behind the scenes, and while i might not be the greatest sysadmin of all time, it's just fun for me.</p>
<p>2. video games</p>
<p>although i totally suck at most games, i love Minecraft (and you should join my server, <a href="https://www.tempuracraft.com">TempuraCraft</a>), team fortress 2, halo, and my favorite game of all time is portal 2 (next to oneshot)</p>
<p>3. collecting tech</p>
<p>i guess this falls under computers and tech, but i love collecting old tech. i have a ton of old phones and want to get more, some old laptops, 3 raspberry pis, a steam deck, and a bunch of used consoles.</p>
<p>4. furry stuff</p>
<p>this one's harder to explain. i have a fursona and am in the community, but the main reason why is because of how nicely i've been treated by the fandom. and they have cake. and hugs.<p>
<p>(in all seriousness, i just find the whole thing very cute and i got into it when i was little, and just stayed here, and if you're interested, my fursona's name is cloud, and they're the blue fox you see all over this site.)</p>
<h2>FAQ</h2>
<h3>Q: how did you get the username squabbled?</h3>
<p>in 8th grade, i had a homework assignment that had the word "squabble" as part of the vocabulary. it's a real word, and it means a really loud petty fight. i thought the word was really funny and it wasn't taken on steam/discord/this site, so here i am.</p>
<h3>Q: what's the story behind your fursona?</h3>
<p>i didn't really "make" them in the typical sense. i found a cute fox skin in minecraft and flipped the colors, and that's been their design since.</p>
<h3>Q: what do you use to make this site?</h3>
<p>just notepad++, basic html and css and github pages! i'm most likely going to switch over to a regular VPS because i'm limited to 1GB of storage here, but i also use cloudflare to save bandwidth and protect the site.</p>
<h3>Q: why does this site look so... old?</h3>
<p>it's intentional. i love older UI design, specifically <a href="https://cari.institute/aesthetics/frutiger-aero">frutiger aero</a> (which this site is supposed to be designed around), and also, my web designing skills are very geocitiesish because i used to make sites with <a href="https://www.neocities.org">Neocities.</a></p>
